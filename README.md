 This started out as practice to see how far i can push my raw skills in wpf however as time passed by i got more hooked into this ui and i am planning on adding a whole layer of functionality to this application. however it wont be too much, at most it is going to be a fully working sql server hooked into a wpf interface however the main goal of this is to have a clean, modern layout / design to it.
